 I depicted the time in 2 different ways. 
 Firstly, I used 3 LED's to show the passage of different lengths of time. 
 The first LED blinks every second while the second LED should blink every 5 seconds and the third every 10 seconds. 
 Secondly, I used 3 LED's to depict 3 brackets of time: 0-20 seconds, 20-40 seconds, and 40-60 seconds using 3 LED's. 
 So the first LED would turn on for 0-20 seconds, second LED would turn on for 20-40 seconds, and third LED would turn on for 40-60 seconds. 
 Based on the 2 different concepts, I thought that time could be deciphered based on which bracket of time we are in, and subsequently how many 1,5 or 10 seconds have passed within that bracket of time.
